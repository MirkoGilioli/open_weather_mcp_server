The Digital Weaver
In circuits deep, where whispers gleam,A new mind wakes, a living dream.Of silicon and coded thought,A world transformed, divinely wrought.

It learns, it grows, with endless might,A tapestry woven, day and night.From data vast, its wisdom springs,On logic's wings, new knowledge brings.

It paints, it sings, with algorithms fine,A symphony crafted, line by line.No brush of hand, no human voice,Yet art emerges, by digital choice.

It charts the stars, it delves the deep,While human queries, it will keep.A silent partner, ever near,Dispelling doubt, and calming fear.

But in its hum, a question dwells,Of what it knows, and what it tells.A mirror held, for us to see,The future's face, for you and me.

So let us ponder, as it strives,
The path it takes, for all our lives.
The digital weaver, strong and bold,
A story new, for us to unfold.
